Security & Volunteer Systems
Municipal authorities coordinate a massive security operation involving Pune Police, traffic staff, and mandal volunteers.

Traditional Security:

Visible Policing: Visible police chowkis (posts) and help desks are established at all major mandals and intersections.   

Volunteer Desks: Mandals deploy their own volunteers for queue management, information, and lost-and-found counters.

Pandal-Level Security: Police have made it compulsory for all Ganesh mandals to install their own CCTV cameras in and around their pandals to ensure localized security and monitoring.   

High-Tech Security Measures (Police Coordinated): Pune Police have implemented an advanced, centralized technology-based security system to monitor the entire festival zone in real-time.

AI Surveillance Network: A network of over 400 AI-enabled CCTV cameras is used for active crowd management. This system identifies potential stampede risks at chokepoints by analyzing crowd density and flow in real-time.   

IP Speaker System: The police control room uses internet protocol (IP) speakers installed in the older city sections. This allows the command center to bypass field radio and give direct, audible instructions to police officers on the ground and to the public, facilitating rapid traffic diversions or crowd dispersal.   

Admin Panel Data: The admin panel should display the volunteer roster, incident logs, and a feed from the AI crowd density alerts (see 15_admin_guidelines_and_data_flow.md).
