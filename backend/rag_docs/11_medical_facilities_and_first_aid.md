Medical Support & First-Aid (Festival Arrangements — 2025)
Given the massive crowds, a multi-tiered medical support system is in place, combining on-site first aid with a network of nearby hospitals.

On-Site First Aid:

Pandal Booths: Major mandals (like Dagdusheth, Kasba) and municipal authorities deploy temporary first-aid stations, ambulance standby, and paramedic booths at high-traffic locations.

Specialized Aid: Some mandals provide specific support. For example, the Tambdi Jogeshwari mandal organizes a special 'eye drop' camp for police personnel on duty to help them cope with fatigue and dust.   

Nearby Hospitals (Emergency Access):

A high concentration of hospitals exists in and around the core festival zone, ensuring rapid emergency response.

Inside the Core Zone (Kasba/Budhwar Peth):

Sahyadri Multispeciality Hospital (Kasba Peth): A full-service hospital located less than 1 km from the Kasba Ganpati temple.   

City Hospital and Diagnostic Centre (Budhwar Peth)    

Jijamata Hospital (Kasba Peth)    

Jabde Hospital (Budhwar Peth)    

On the Periphery (Major Hospitals):

KEM Hospital (Rasta Peth): A major, well-equipped hospital approx. 2.5 km from the core.   

Sassoon General Hospital: A large public, government hospital located near the Pune Railway Station.   

Sahyadri Super Speciality Hospital (Deccan Gymkhana): Another major facility near the Deccan access point, approx. 2.5 km away.   

App Guidance: In an emergency, the app should list the nearest on-site first-aid booth first, followed by the closest full-service hospital like Sahyadri (Kasba Peth) or KEM Hospital.
