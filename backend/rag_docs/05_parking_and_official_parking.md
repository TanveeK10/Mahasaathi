Official Parking Zones & Advice (Pune Ganpati 2025)
To support the "park-and-walk" strategy, Pune Police and PMC designate numerous official parking lots on the periphery of the central festival zone. Vehicles are not permitted in the core Peth areas after 5 PM.   

Paid parking is available at these selected lots; using them is highly recommended to avoid towing.
