Road Restrictions & Traffic Management (Festival-time playbook — projected 2025)
Pune Police and PMC declare temporary road closures, one-way traffic, and parking restrictions to manage the immense crowds in the central Peth areas. The core strategy is to create a large, pedestrian-only zone.   

Core Road Closures (Daily): To facilitate devotees and processions, major central roads are typically closed to all vehicular traffic every evening after 5:00 PM until the crowds disperse.   

Key closures include:

Laxmi Road: From Hamjekhan Chowk to Tilak Chowk.   

Shivaji Road: From Gadgil Statue Chowk to Jedhe Chowk / Mandai Area.   

Bajirao Road: From Puram Chowk to Appa Balwant Chowk.   

Tilak Road: From Hirabaug Chowk to Nehru Stadium / Alka Talkies Chowk.   

Kumthekar Road: From Tilak Chowk to Chitale Corner Chowk.   

Kelkar Road: From Budhwar Chowk to Alka Talkies Chowk.   

Ganesh Road: From Daruwala Bridge to Jijamata Chowk.   

Visarjan Day Closures: On Anant Chaturdashi (the final immersion day), these closures start much earlier, typically from 9:00 AM, 10:00 AM, or Noon, and last until the procession ends.   

Heavy Vehicle Ban: A complete ban on heavy vehicles (buses, trucks, dumpers) is enforced on 12 or more major roads, including Shastri Road, Karve Road, FC Road, and JM Road, for the duration of the festival.   

Traffic Diversions:

Vehicular traffic is rerouted to peripheral roads. For example, motorists on Jangali Maharaj (JM) Road heading towards Swargate are mandated to turn left at SG Barve Chowk and rerouted.   

PMPML buses are also diverted from the central Peths.   

Police use IP-based speakers to issue live diversion instructions.   

User Guidance: Check local Pune Police social media / control room for up-to-the-minute closures. For directions in chat: prefer pedestrian routes or official transport stops ; avoid private-route navigation as closures are dynamic.
