Cultural Notes: Ganeshotsav & Pune (Context)
Pune's Ganeshotsav is not just a festival; it is a cultural and political institution. Its modern form was shaped by two key phases in the late 19th century.

Phase 1: The Revolutionary Prototype (1892)

While private Ganesha worship is ancient, the first (or one of the first) 'Sarvajanik' (public) Ganpatis was established in 1892 by Shrimant Bhausaheb Rangari.   

Rangari was a 'Rajvaidya' (royal physician) and a freedom fighter who used his home for secret revolutionary meetings.   

His 1892 idol was explicitly political: it was made of wood and bran and depicted Ganesha fiercely slaying a demon, which was an unambiguous symbol for the British colonialists. This was Ganeshotsav as a direct, radical call to arms.   

Phase 2: The Mass Movement (1893) & 'Manache Ganpati'

A year later, in 1893, the nationalist leader Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak saw the immense potential of this public celebration to unite the masses.   

Tilak, a master organizer, scaled the concept. He convened a meeting of prominent citizens, including Dagdusheth Halwai , and transformed the festival into a 10-day mass public event.   

To prevent rivalries and give the festival a formal structure, Tilak established the 'Manache Ganpati' (The Honored Five) — a brilliant hierarchy that dictates the order of the final immersion (Visarjan) procession.   

The 'Manache' Hierarchy (The Order of Honor):

Shree Kasba Ganpati: First honor. Chosen as it is the city's ancient 'Gram Devta' (village deity), established by Jijabai in the 1630s. This grounded Tilak's new movement in the city's oldest spiritual foundation.   

Tambdi Jogeshwari: Second honor. Chosen as it is the 'Gram Devi' (village goddess), housed in a 15th-century temple.   

Guruji Talim: Third honor. Chosen as it was a senior mandal (est. 1887) and a powerful symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity, co-founded by both communities.   

Tulshibaug Ganpati: Fourth honor. Represents the festival's popular appeal and artistry, with its 15-foot-tall idol and elaborate decorations.   

Kesari Wada Ganpati: Fifth honor. This was Tilak's own mandal, located at the office of his 'Kesari' newspaper. Its inclusion was Tilak's signature, cementing his own legacy into the structure he created.   

This history is key: Pune's Ganeshotsav is a celebration that blends ancient faith (Kasba) with radical politics (Rangari) and mass nationalist organization (Tilak).
