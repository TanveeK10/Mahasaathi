Public Transport Guidance — PMPML & Pune Metro (2025)
With central roads closed to private vehicles , public transport is the primary mode of access to the festival core.   

PMPML (Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited)
Special "Jatra" Services: PMPML operates a large number of additional buses (620 to 790+) to accommodate the festival surge.   

Night Bus Service: These special services run throughout the night, allowing devotees to visit late-night pandals and return home.   

Special Fares: An additional charge (e.g., ₹5 or ₹10 per ticket) is typically levied for the special night services. Standard bus passes are often not accepted on these services after midnight.   

Key Hubs: Major hubs for these festival buses are established at peripheral points, including Swargate, Shivajinagar, Deccan, Hadapsar, Pune Railway Station, and the Manapa Bhavan (PMC building). Buses are diverted around the closed Peth areas.   

Pune Metro (Purple/Aqua lines)
Extended Hours: Metro services are significantly extended, typically running from 6:00 AM to 12:00 Midnight for most of the festival.   

Immersion Day (Anant Chaturdashi): On the final day, the Metro provides continuous, non-stop service. This can be for 24 hours (6 AM to 6 AM the next day)  or even 41 hours straight (e.g., 6 AM on one day to 11 PM the following day) to manage the immense crowd.   

Increased Frequency: Train frequency is increased during peak festival times, running as often as every 5 minutes.   

Key Stations: The stations with the highest footfall for pandal-hopping are PMC Metro Station, Deccan Gymkhana Metro Station, and Pune Railway Station Metro Station. These stations act as "feeder" points, dropping passengers at the edge of the pedestrian-only zone.   

Indian Railways
Pune Railway Station handles special trains occasionally; crowd advisories apply near station exits. The Pune Railway Station Metro stop provides a direct link from IR services to the festival feeder system.
