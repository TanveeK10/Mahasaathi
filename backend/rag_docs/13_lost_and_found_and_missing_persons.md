Lost & Found & Missing Person Protocol
In a crowd of millions, managing lost individuals (especially children and the elderly) is a critical safety challenge. A proposed high-tech solution leverages RFID technology, similar to systems tested at other mass gatherings.   

Proposed RFID Tracking System: This system is designed for rapid identification and reunification.   

Registration:

Visitors (e.g., a family with children) can optionally register at festival entry points.

They receive a passive, low-cost RFID tag (e.g., a wristband or card).   

This tag's Unique ID is linked to the parent's/guardian's personal details (name, mobile number) on a secure, cloud-based server.   

Tracking & Identification:

The passive tags require no battery.   

If a child is found separated, any official at a police chowki or help desk with a mobile RFID reader can scan the tag.

The reader queries the cloud database, retrieves the Unique ID, and immediately finds the linked parent's contact details, allowing for a call/alert to be sent.   

Admin Panel Alert:

If a user reports a missing family member via the app, the app should ask for their registration ID.

This triggers an admin alert. The admin panel should display the last-known "ping" from a fixed RFID reader (if deployed at chokepoints) and immediately alert volunteers and police with the missing person's details.   

This system is superior to manual checks as it provides instant, verifiable identification, drastically reducing the time and panic involved in a "lost person" scenario.
