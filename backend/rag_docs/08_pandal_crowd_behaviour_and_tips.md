Crowd Behaviour Guidance & High-Tech Management
Visitor Tips
Expected Surges: Evenings (18:00–23:00) after work hours and main aarti timings. Weekends and the final two days see the heaviest crowds.

Family Advice: Establish clear meeting points (e.g., "at the entrance of SP College parking") and ensure all members have offline contact numbers. RFID bracelets (see 13_lost_and_found_and_missing_persons.md) can help family tracking.

Accessibility: Seek senior-citizen lanes and special entry passes where provided (e.g., Kasba Ganpati).

Food + Hygiene: Prefer official stalls with visible waste disposal and nearby portable toilets.

High-Tech Crowd Management (AI Surveillance)
Pune Police now employ a high-tech, AI-driven crowd management system to ensure public safety and prevent stampedes. This system is based on technology proven at other large-scale Indian gatherings like the Maha Kumbh Mela.   

How it Works: A network of over 400 AI-enabled CCTV cameras  monitors the festival core.   

Data Analysis: The system uses computer vision for :   

Crowd Density Estimation: Calculating the number of people in a specific area (with 90-95% accuracy).   

People Flow Tracking: Monitoring the speed and direction of crowd movement.   

Threat Detection: Identifying high-risk choke points (especially near Metro stations like PMC and Mandai).   

ICCC & Alerts: This data is fed to an Integrated Control & Command Centre (ICCC). If crowd density exceeds pre-determined safety thresholds, an alarm is sounded, alerting authorities to intervene before a dangerous situation (like a stampede) occurs.   

Field Response: The control room can then dispatch police and use IP-based speakers in the Peth areas to give live, audible instructions to the crowd and field officers.   

Pandal-Level: All individual mandals are also required by police to install their own CCTV cameras for localized security
