Local Navigation: The 'Park-and-Walk' Strategy
During Ganeshotsav, navigation in the central Peth areas is not about "shortcuts"; it is about the official, police-enforced pedestrian-only zones.   

The Core Strategy: The entire logistical plan (road closures, parking, public transport) is a unified "Park-and-Walk" (or "Park-and-Ride") model.

Road Closures: Central roads (Laxmi, Shivaji, Bajirao) are closed to all vehicles after 5 PM.   

Peripheral Hubs: Visitors are directed to park at designated lots  or arrive at public transport hubs (PMPML buses , Pune Metro ) located on the perimeter of the central zone.   

Walking Routes: Visitors then walk from these "feeder" hubs into the pedestrianized core.

Key Walking Corridors:

From the West (Deccan):

Source: Alight at Deccan Gymkhana Metro Station  or park at Fergusson College  or the River Bed (Bhide Bridge).   

Route: Walk across the bridges (Sambhaji, Balgandharva) and use JM Road / FC Road to access the core Peths.

From the North (Shivajinagar):

Source: Alight at PMC Metro Station  or Shivajinagar Bus Hub.   

Route: Walk south on Shivaji Road (which is closed to vehicles)  towards Kasba Ganpati and the central mandals.   

From the South (Swargate):

Source: Alight at Swargate Bus Hub  or park at SP College  or Sarasbaug/Peshwe Park.   

Route: Walk north up Tilak Road  or Laxmi Road  into the heart of the festival.   

App/Chatbot Guidance: Directions should always prefer pedestrian routing within the core Peths. For any distance over 1-2 km, the system should route the user to a peripheral parking lot 1 or Metro/PMPML hub 2 first, and then provide walking directions from there.
