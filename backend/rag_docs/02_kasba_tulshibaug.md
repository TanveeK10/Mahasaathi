Kasba Ganapati & Tulshibaug Area — Practical Guide (2025)
This guide covers the 'Manacha Pahila' (First Honored) Kasba Ganpati and the adjacent Tulshibaug market area, which hosts the 'Manacha Chautha' (Fourth Honored) mandal.

Kasba Ganapati ('Manacha Pahila')
Kasba Ganapati is one of Pune’s oldest mandals and is revered as the 'Gram Devta' (presiding village deity) of Pune city.   

History & Significance: The temple was commissioned by Jijabai Bhosale, the mother of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, in the 1630s. This was after an idol of Ganapati was reportedly found near the Lal Mahal, Shivaji's childhood residence.   

'Manacha Pahila': It holds the distinction of being the first and highest honor ('Manacha Pahila Ganpati') in the annual Ganeshotsav immersion procession. This hierarchy was established by Lokmanya Tilak to organize the festival and prevent rivalries.   

The Idol: The idol is considered 'Swayambhu' (self-originated). Local tradition holds that the idol was originally the size of a grain of rice and has grown larger over the centuries from the continuous application of 'sindoor' (vermilion paste).   

Tulshibaug Area (Market & 'Manacha Chautha')
Tulshibaug is the adjacent bustling market and cultural area, famous for its historic shops, eateries, and traditional crafts. It is also the location of the fourth honored Ganpati, the Tulshibaug Ganpati Mandal.   

Access & Transport: Both Kasba and Tulshibaug are in the heart of the old city, accessible from Laxmi Road and Bajirao Road. During the festival, the entire area is pedestrianized, especially after 5 PM.   

Mobility: Use PMPML shuttle services  or Pune Metro (alight at PMC or Deccan stations and walk). Parking is extremely limited; use official peripheral lots (like SP College or Fergusson College) and walk.   

Crowd Patterns & Timing: Peak crowd times align with evening aarti and weekend afternoons. The Kasba mandal typically organizes special darshan passes for senior citizens. Local police implement one-way pedestrian flows on peak days.   

Nearby Services: Public toilets are placed on Tulshibaug main lanes during the festival. Temporary medical vans and police chowkis are common. Food stalls cluster on side lanes; some are centuries-old establishments.
