Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati — Overview & Visiting Info (2025)
Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganapati (Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganapati) is Pune’s most famous and popular Ganpati mandal, located near Budhwar Peth.   

Founding History: The temple's origin is one of personal tragedy. In the late 1800s, Shrimant Dagdusheth Halwai (a successful sweet-seller and wrestler) and his wife, Lakshmibai, lost their only son to the plague epidemic. Grief-stricken, they were advised by their spiritual guide, Shri Madhavanth Maharaj, to build a Ganesha temple for the welfare of all people.   

Role in Ganeshotsav: Dagdusheth Halwai, who held the civic title of 'Nagarsheth' (chief merchant), was invited by Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak to a meeting in 1893 to help transform the festival into a public ('Sarvajanik') event. The new, popular Dagdusheth idol became a focal point for Tilak's nationalist movement, creating a symbiotic relationship between faith and the freedom struggle.   

The Idol & Finances: The current, iconic idol was consecrated in 1968. It is famously adorned with approximately 40 kg of gold, donated by devotees over the years. For the 125th anniversary, a new 9.5 kg gold crown was crafted , and in 2021, an anonymous devotee donated a 5 kg gold 'mukut' (crown) valued at Rs 6 crore.   

Insurance: The mandal employs a multi-layered insurance strategy:

Idol Insurance: The main idol itself is insured for a sum of ₹10 million (approx. US$120,000).

Ornament Insurance: The valuable gold ornaments are covered by a separate, high-value policy for an undisclosed amount.   

Event Insurance: The trust holds a massive event policy for the 10-day Ganeshotsav, valued at Rs 50 crore per day, to cover risks like stampedes or threats.   

Location & Access: Dagdusheth Mandir sits in central Pune (Budhwar Peth / Laxmi Road area). Nearest public transport: Shivaji Nagar / Deccan Road junction, multiple PMPML bus routes  and Pune Metro stations (PMC, Deccan Gymkhana) , and local auto stands; walkable from Laxmi Road parking lots. The mandal area is typically traffic restricted during Ganeshotsav (road closures on Laxmi Road and nearby lanes).
